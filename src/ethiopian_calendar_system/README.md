# Ethiopian Calendar System (Bahire Hasab Implementation)

## Future Implementation Project

This directory is reserved for implementing the proper **Bahire Hasab** (ባሕረ ሃሳብ) Ethiopian Orthodox calendar calculation system.

## Scope

### What Will Be Implemented:
- **True Bahire Hasab calculations** using ancient mathematical formulas
- **Ethiopian Orthodox Easter (Fasika) calculation** with proper lunar cycles
- **Complete feast and fasting calendar** system
- **Astronomical calculations** for religious observances
- **Traditional Ethiopian Orthodox computus** methods

### Research Areas:
- Pope Demetrius I of Alexandria formulas (3rd century)
- Abu Shakir Ibn al-Rahib computational methods
- The 8 Rules/Conventions of Bahire Hasab
- Julian calendar integration with Ethiopian year cycles
- Lunar month calculations for moveable feasts

### Target Accuracy:
- **Fasika (Easter) dates** matching Ethiopian Orthodox Church
- **All moveable feasts** (Palm Sunday, Ascension, Pentecost)
- **Fasting periods** (Great Lent, Advent, etc.)
- **Saint commemorations** and fixed feasts

## Current Status: Research Phase

This is a **future project** that requires:
1. Deep research into traditional Ethiopian Orthodox calendar methods
2. Access to authentic Bahire Hasab source materials
3. Consultation with Ethiopian Orthodox scholars/priests
4. Mathematical modeling of ancient astronomical calculations

## Integration

Once completed, this system will:
- Replace the approximate calculations in `../calendar/`
- Provide 100% accurate Ethiopian Orthodox calendar
- Support liturgical applications with perfect precision
- Serve as reference implementation for Ethiopian calendar systems

**Note**: The current calendar system in `../calendar/` remains functional for immediate needs while this proper implementation is being developed.
